# -Predicting-On-Time-Deliveries
 Predicting On-Time Deliveries
 Overview
This Python script demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier to predict on-time deliveries based on a provided dataset. The model evaluates the importance of various features and visualizes them through a bar plot.

Dependencies
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Usage
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Script:

Save your dataset as a CSV file (e.g., 'your_dataset.csv').
Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with your actual dataset filename in the script.
Execute the script to load the data, preprocess it, and train the Random Forest model.
Interpret Results:

View the first few rows of the dataset, the correlation matrix heatmap, and the most correlated variables with the target variable ('Reached.on.Time_Y.N').
Analyze the feature importance scores obtained from the trained Random Forest model.
Explore the bar plot showcasing the importance of each feature in predicting on-time deliveries.
Notes
Ensure your dataset is appropriately formatted and includes the necessary columns ('ID', 'Warehouse_block', 'Mode_of_Shipment', 'Customer_care_calls', 'Customer_rating', 'Cost_of_the_Product', 'Prior_purchases', 'Product_importance', 'Gender', 'Discount_offered', 'Weight_in_gms', 'Reached.on.Time_Y.N').
Adjust the script according to your specific dataset characteristics.
